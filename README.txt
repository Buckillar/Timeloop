BUG FIX -- Score Calculation
    * Corrected how the score is calculated as was using time left rather than time taken. 
        ** ie if only took a few seconds to complete score = 178 rather than 002

Added Menu Screen
    * Option to Start Game with Intro Story
    * Option to Start Game without Intro Story

Added Win Screen
    * Win Screen prompts for Name and then uses this to create top score and ends story or does it?!
Added Top Score screen
    * Top Score list generated by data created by me
    * List is stopped at 10 items so as not to create never ending list
    * New Items are sorted be score amount! Less is better
